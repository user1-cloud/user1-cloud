***

 - ## Solaris-3
> Sol-III, the third planet from the sun. A world of chaos and change, where old conventions are discarded and disasters run rampant. Human civilization struggles to survive in this new era of destruction and rebirth, facing uncharted challenges with unwavering determination.

***

 - ## Waveworn Phenomenon
> The Lament's power causes destructive anomalies, such as the "Tacet Fields", "Tacet Discord Outbreaks", and the mysterious matter named "Tacetite". These are collectively known as the "Waveworn Phenomena".

***

 - ## Lament
> The term "Lament" refers to the ongoing catastrophic events on Solaris-3. Since the first Lament, destruction has been nonstop and unyielding. The tide of devastation continues without pause, with no signs of slowing down.

***

 - ## Tacet Field
> The "Tacet Fields" are thought to be where all Tacet Discords originate. These locations feature a sky of inverted seas and a deep cross-shaped Tacet Mark on the ground. Reverberations fill the air, linking our world to an unknown space through a white Resonance Cord. These areas attract gatherings of Tacet Discords.

***

 - ## Resonator
> Individuals with the ability to resonate with certain objects and manipulate their frequencies are known as "Resonators". These individuals exhibit unique "Resonance Abilities", also known as their "Fortes", through the "Tacet Mark" on their bodies. According to experts, a Resonator's abilities are often influenced by their past experiences and subconscious mind.

***

 - ## Tacet Discord
> Tacet Discords, created by the Waveworn Phenomena, are dangerous entities with ever-changing, amorphous forms. They possess "Tacet Cores" and feed on other frequencies to maintain stability and evolve. These creatures mimic their prey's abilities, shapes, and behaviors, influenced by the types of frequency they consume.

***

 - ## Echo
> Tacet Discords may leave behind "Reverberations" when they are eliminated, which can then be transformed into "Echoes" through the Pangu Terminal's Data Bank, providing a useful advantage in battle.

***

 - ## Sentinel
> Wherever there is civilization and history, there will be Sentinels. They serve as mankind's guardians and guides. Their immortal existence has helped humanity through countless troubles, sharing wisdom and prophecies. As we embark on a new journey after enduring the Lament, the Sentinels remain our record keeper and beacon in times of disaster.

***

 - ## Jinzhou
> Jinzhou, a fortified city on the frontier, stands guard against the looming Tacet Discord crisis. As one of Huanglong's six major regions, it bears the weight of this responsibility as the youngest city. The Midnight Rangers defend its northern border without falter.

***

 - ## Threnodian
> Threnodians are formidable creatures born from the Laments, with the power to destroy human spirit and feed off of their collapsed will. If civilizations represent mankind's collective will, the Threnodians embody our fears and struggles. They manifest as destructive Tacet Discord disasters spreading across the planet.

***

 - ## Reverberation
> The Waveworn Phenomena is believed to alter matter, information, and energy by converting them into vibrating "frequencies", referred to as "Reverberations". This process has been observed through experimental evidence in the academic community.

***

 - ## Remnant
> In their studies of Waveworn Phenomena, scientists discovered "Tacetite" — a substance that can permanently hold Remnant Energy. The Tacetite can be made into potent weapons for Resonators to combat Tacet Discords. Transdimensional spaces where Remnant Energy is abundant are known as the Sonoro Spheres.
